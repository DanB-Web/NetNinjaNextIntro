Net Ninja Next JS Intro

## What is Next.js?

- Framework for creating pre-rendered React websites
- Offers both Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)

## SSR

- React components are rendered into HTML on the server AS REQUESTED by the client

## SSG

- Complete HTML pages are generated AT BUILD TIME

## Benefits

- React is a Client Side Rendered (CSR) technology - SSR and SSG can often be quicker as there is less processing on the browser side. There are also SEO benefits (web crawlers get full HTML back rather than an emtpy React hook).
